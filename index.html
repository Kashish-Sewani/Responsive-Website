            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits
                and manifests in various forms. Formal education occurs within a structured institutional framework,
                such as public schools, following a curriculum. Non-formal education also follows a structured approach
                but occurs outside the formal schooling system, while informal education entails unstructured learning
                through daily experiences. Formal and non-formal education are categorized into levels, including early
                childhood education, primary education, secondary education, and tertiary education. </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The precise definition of education is disputed, and there are
                disagreements about the aims of education and the extent to which education differs from indoctrination
                by fostering critical thinking. These disagreements impact how to identify, measure, and enhance various
                forms of education. Essentially, education socializes children into society by instilling cultural
                values and norms, equipping them with the skills necessary to become productive members of society. In
                doing so, it stimulates economic growth and raises awareness of local and global problems. Organized
                institutions play a significant role in education. For instance, governments establish education
                policies to determine the timing of school classes, the curriculum, and attendance requirements.
                International organizations, such as UNESCO, have been influential in promoting primary education for
                all children.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">In the Islamic civilization that spread all the way between China and
                Spain during the time between the 7th and 19th centuries, Muslims started schooling from 622 in Medina,
                which is now a city in Saudi Arabia, schooling at first was in the mosques (masjid in Arabic) but then
                schools became separate in schools next to mosques. The first separate school was the Nizamiyah school.
                It was built in 1066 in Baghdad. Children started school from the age of six with free tuition. The
                Quran encourages Muslims to be educated. Thus, education and schooling sprang up in the ancient Muslim
                societies. Moreover, Muslims had one of the first universities in history which is Al-Qarawiyin
                University in Fez, Morocco. It was originally a mosque that was built in 859 </p>
